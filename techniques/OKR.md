# OKR:  Objectives and Key Results

It's a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.

The OKR framework aims to define company and team "objectives" along with linked and measurable "key results" to provide "a critical thinking framework and ongoing discipline that seeks to ensure employees work together, focusing their efforts to make measurable contributions." OKRs are typically set at the company, team and personal levels and may be shared across the organization with the intention of providing teams with visibility of goals with the intention to align and focus effort.
