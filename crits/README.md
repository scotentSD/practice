# Design Critiques (Crits)
## What is a Design Crit(ique)?
- It is a critique or review of a design that will support teh designer with helpfuul feedback at an early stage
- It is highly organised to ensure that it delivers useful insights and does not descend into a moan-fest 
- They are there to make things better :-)

## What are the benefits
- a second (etc) opinion 
- or an outsider's view
- de-risk your design
- to mitigate bias
- to stress-test your design
- test ideas
- to share your work
and they make people feel more confident that things are going in the right direction

## Roles
- Person who wants something critiqued. Lets call them the **"Design Owner"**
- **Note Taker**
- Reviewers. Lets call them **"Criters"**

# Design Owner
Have a quick look at the [GDS style Powerpoint on Design Crits V2](GDSDesignCcritsv2.pptx)
 
## 1. Set the context
- who are the users?
- what do they need?
- what stage is the project at?
- what are our current assumptions?

## 2. Say what kind of feedback you want
- graphic design
- interaction design
- service design
- content design

## 3. Let the team review the work
- don’t give a demo
- don’t talk too much
- don’t get defensive
- do take notes
- do listen

## Prepare the following info to take to the Crit
- What have you brought for critique?
- What stage is it at?
- How did you get to this point?
- What kind of feedback do you want?
- Who are the users?
- What are the user needs?
- What is the policy intent?
- What assumptions or constraints are you working with?
- A map/summary of these activities and diagrams such as this [SEP Crit Prep Page](https://numbat70.github.io/SEP)
- Fill in a [Crit Canvas](Saltire_Crit_Canvas.pdf) and bring it with you

- Criticism is personal  —  Critique **is objective**
- Criticism is vague  —  Critique **is concrete**
- Criticism tears down  —  Critique **builds up**
- Criticism is ego-centric  —  Critique **is altruistic**
- Criticism is adversarial  —  Critique **is cooperative**
- Criticism belittles the designer  —  Critique **improves the design**
