# Problems people face when accessing digital

## Access
### Accessibility

### Location
- Transport issues can limit people accessing physical services.
- Location can limit roadband connectivity
- Location can effect social inclusion which in turn may impact other things such as education and skills
- Location may directly impact on education choices
- Location may effect what services are available locally
- loneliness and social isolation may impact on peoples desire to reach out
- Location can make cost of living higher thus further limiting available cash for other things

### Cost
- Economically disadvantaged populations may be barred from acessing services due to cost
- When cost is applied to a service it is often inferred as a mark of value. This can be a good or bad thing.

### Technology
- Digital inclusion can be limited by access to relevant technology
- Many people only use mobile devices to access digital chanels. If these chanels are not optimised for "Mobile" then they are directly impacted.

### Infrastructure
- Broadband speed is the most common infrastructure limitation for accessing services.
