## Summary
During Covid, businesses may experience issues with handling "Physical Post"
- Letters and Parcels are still addressed to offices
- Offices have periods of being unstaffed
- You can't hand out employees' home addresses
- Having physical post collected shares the same issues

SO
- Some staff could visit offices in "managed ways" periodically
- Some mail redirect methods were used
- Messaging to customers and clients was needed to highlight the extra time needed to process and respond to physical artefacts
- Talking to banks to "increase flexibility to reflect these longer response times and Cash Flow issues" was needed.

## Chronology
- Banks physically opened and closed throughout 2020
- Business offices were open and closed throughout 2020

## Variations
- Local variations exist / existed around physical travel which would impact access to offices
