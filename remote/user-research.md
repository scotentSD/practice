- We need to be thinking of not how we replicate what we did before, but what are the needs/outcomes we really want to achieve (do we really need to do a workshop for example?)
- Jonathan Nichols: @GDSTeam are releasing a blog on remote UR as well as list of remote UR tools v soon. @DhruvSharma101has created a google doc repository too, structured against use cases, rather than type of tools
- We need to think now about knowledge management, more important now than ever. How do we em board people new to the organisation without a knowledge repository? - @lily_dart (also what happens if URers fall ill?)
- Ethics and safeguarding are both important. How do we go about doing safe research with children? We also need to do research with those that are digitally excluded, and we need to find a way to do that - @svmboyd
- Thereâ€™s an interesting opportunity potentially to connect ourselves into the grassroots local networks who are engaging with those that are socially isolated. We also need to remember that we have phones and can do interviews over phone
 - Should we continue doing research? Balance the risk of doing it against not doing it. Is this is going to burden participants or is the environment is going to affect the outcomes of research? We need to look at each case. May be opportunity to do internal user research (all)
 - And last but definitely not the least, be kind, with ourselves, colleagues, and participants and be honest with participants about our constraints. It is really hard balancing work on childcare & we don't have all the answers yet - and all
