# In Progress - Brexit - Research Summary

We have been researching Brexit with business customers for well over a year now. 
There has been a journey of peoples attitudes:
- Bayond a year ago, people were very keen to find out more info to help them plan
- Around 9 Months ago, people were now willing to wait and see what details transpired. Their understanding had matured to the point of realising that there were no hard facts yet.
- In teh last 6 months people have become quite cynical about Brexit. They are no longer expecting answers and have quite a fatalistic approach to it

The main word we hear now is: "Uncertainty"

## Uncertainty

This one word summarises the entirety of our research quite well.
Most effects of Brexit are due to Uncertainty rather than cold hard facts. 

- Many initiatives are being put on hold until after Brexit
- Funding decisions are being put on hold
- Planning is suffering due to uncertainty
- Idividuals  are making life and career choices based on uncertainty and the inherent risk that this brings. An example of this is EU nationals returning to their home country as they do not want to enroll their children in a Scottish School and then hvae to uproot them during teh school year.
